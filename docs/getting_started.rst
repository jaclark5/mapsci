Getting Started
===============

How do I use it?
----------------
Once installed, you can:
 * Import the package and use it in python scripting. Note that the parameters are temperature dependent.
 * This package can be used as a plug-in for our equation of state package, [DESPASITO](https://github.com/jaclark5/despasito). You won't need to worry about temperature dependence in this case, it'll be taken care of internally.

Installation
------------

Install using pip with ``pip install mapsci``

Alternatively, download the master branch from our github page as a zip file, or clone it with git via ``git clone https://github.com/jaclark5/mapsci`` in your working directory. Install MAPSCI locally from the working directory with ``python setup.py install --user``.
